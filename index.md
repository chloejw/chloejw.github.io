## 👋 Welcome!  

I'm Chloe Wright, a mathematics major with a passion for **data science, predictive modeling, and actuarial analysis**. Whether it's forecasting **medical costs**, predicting **delivery times**, or analyzing **real estate pricing trends**, I love uncovering insights through data.  

With a background in **Python, R, SQL, and C++**, I thrive at the intersection of mathematics, technology, and business decision-making. Beyond the numbers, I lead as **President of Pi Mu Epsilon** and **Mathematics Major Ambassador at SNHU**, fostering a strong academic community.
